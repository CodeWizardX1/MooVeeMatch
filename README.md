## **About the Project**  
MooVeeMatch is a Python-based command-line program that recommends movies based on the userâ€™s mood. Whether youâ€™re feeling uplifting, adventurous, romantic, or dark, MooVeeMatch helps you find films that fit your vibe, making movie selection a breeze.

---

## **Features**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Mood-Based Search**: Enter your mood, and MooVeeMatch finds the closest match from its curated database.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Extensive Movie Database**: Categorized by moods like "uplifting," "dark," "romantic," and more.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Interactive CLI**: Simple and user-friendly command-line interface.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Customizable**: Easily expand the movie database to include your favorite films.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Built for Learning**: Compare the original and refactored versions to study Python coding practices.

---

## **How It Works**
1. The user inputs the beginning letters of their mood (e.g., "u" for "uplifting").
2. MooVeeMatch matches the input against its movie database using a hash map (Python dictionary) and pattern matching.
3. If a match is found, the program displays a list of movies for that mood, including their title, release year, and description.
4. Users can continue exploring other moods or exit the program.
